# anoCon : A WebRTC Video Call Application

<img src="/public/anoCon.png" align="center">

## Overview

This project is a simple WebRTC video call application that enables real-time audio and video communication between users. It uses Firebase Firestore for signaling and ID mapping, allowing users to connect by sharing unique identifiers.

## Hosting

A working model has been hosted on https://anoconsession.vercel.app/ 

**Note**-The hosting was done from our own forked repository that you may find here:

**Steps to start a video call session:**
- **Step-1**: Click the start webcam button and allow the video and audio access permission.
- **Step-2(Call offer)**: One of the peers can initiate a call by entering a code in the "Create New Call" text space and clicking the Create Call Button.
- **Step-3(Answer the call)**: Using the same code a receiver can access the call by entering the same ID to the Answer Call text space and clicking the Answer Call Button afterwards.
- **Step-4(Hang-Up)**: Click on the Hang Up button when necessary to end the call.

## Features

- **WebRTC Video and Audio**: Real-time video and audio communication using WebRTC.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Utilizes Firestore for signaling to manage offers and answers between peers.
- **ID Mapping**: Allows users to connect via a shortened unique ID, which maps to a call document in Firestore.

## Technologies Used

- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer audio/video streaming.
- **Firebase**: For backend services including Firestore for data storage and signaling.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Basic web technologies for the user interface.
